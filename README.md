# Precision Agriculture - Coimbatore based crop suggestion system using ML and IoT

- Farmers are not aware of the right crop according to their soil characteristics and site specific parameters. Due to this the yield can be low and they face a setback in productivity.
- A system to recommend the most appropriate crop to farmers using machine learning techniques based on certain input parameters like soil pH, EC (Electrical Conductivity), N, P, K, soil type, area and environmental conditions like temperature and rainfall will help significantly increase productivity and reduce loss.
- The trained model is further given real time inputs from the IoT system along with user inputs to give the output.

# Methodology Used

- Ensemble model with majority voting technique, using a combination of algorithm namely Random Forest, kNN, and Decision Tree with 89.27% accuracy.

# Hardware Used

- Arduino UNO Board
